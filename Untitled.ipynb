    "## Deep dive into Node.js architecture\n",
    "### 1. What is Node.js?\n",
    "- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n",
    "- Historically used primarily in web browsers, Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.\n",
    "- Consequently, Node.js represents a \"JavaScript everywhere\" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts. It's built on the V8 JavaScript runtime and helps in developing scalable network applications.\n",
    "- It's known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model which makes it efficient and suitable for real-time applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is V8?\n",
    "- V8 is a high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine developed by Google.\n",
    "- Written in C++, it is used in Google Chrome and also provides the runtime environment for Node.js.\n",
    "- V8 compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code before executing it, instead of using an interpreter.\n",
    "- It implements ECMAScript as specified in ECMA-262, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x86, x64, or ARM processors.\n",
    "- V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application. Its performance focus and continual optimization have played a significant role in the widespread use of JavaScript outside the browser, enabling complex and resource-intensive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is stream?\n",
    "- In Node.js, a stream is an abstraction used for handling the flow of data.\n",
    "- It is an implementation of the EventEmitter class and provides a way to handle reading from or writing to data sources in a continuous manner.\n",
    "- Streams are essential for efficiently managing large volumes of data or data that is received incrementally over time.\n",
    "- They help to minimize memory usage and optimize data processing speed.\n",
    "- There are four main types of streams in Node.js:\n",
    "    - Readable,\n",
    "    - Writable,\n",
    "    - Duplex (both readable and writable),\n",
    "    - Transform (a type of duplex stream that can modify or transform the data as it is read and written).\n",
    "- Streams are widely used in Node.js for tasks such as reading from files, processing HTTP requests, and handling data in real-time applications.\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const fs = require('fs');\n",
    "\n",
    "// Create a readable stream\n",
    "const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');\n",
    "readableStream.on('data', function(chunk) {\n",
    "    console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`);\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "// Create a writable stream\n",
    "const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');\n",
    "writableStream.write('Hello world!\\n');\n",
    "\n",
    "// Pipe from readable to writable\n",
    "readableStream.pipe(writableStream);\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What V8 streams do you know?\n",
    "- The term 'V8 streams' might be a bit misleading as streams are a part of Node.js, not the V8 engine.\n",
    "- V8 is the JavaScript engine that powers Node.js, and it doesn’t provide a streaming data handling mechanism of its own.\n",
    "- Instead, streams in Node.js are implemented on top of the V8 engine's capabilities, utilizing JavaScript's event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O model to handle streaming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What optimization techniques of V8 do you know?\n",
    "- V8 employs several sophisticated optimization techniques to enhance the performance of JavaScript execution.\n",
    "    - One key technique is **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compilation, where V8 compiles JavaScript to machine code at runtime for faster execution.\n",
    "    - Other techniques include **inline caching**, which speeds up property access by remembering the locations of previously accessed properties, and hidden classes, which optimize object property access.\n",
    "    - V8 also uses an optimizing compiler named TurboFan, which generates efficient machine code for JavaScript.\n",
    "    - Another important aspect is garbage collection, optimized to reclaim memory in an efficient and non-blocking manner.\n",
    "- These optimizations allow V8 to execute JavaScript at speeds comparable to other compiled languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. What is the main idea of demultiplexer pattern?\n",
    "- The demultiplexer pattern, especially relevant in the context of Node.js, is a behavioral design pattern used in event-driven architectures.\n",
    "- It refers to efficiently routing incoming events or data to the correct handler.\n",
    "- This pattern is crucial in handling concurrency in Node.js, allowing a single thread to manage multiple I/O operations.\n",
    "- When an I/O request is initiated, it gets demultiplexed or delegated to the event loop, which then handles the event asynchronously.\n",
    "- Once the operation is complete, the response is routed back to the appropriate callback function.\n",
    "- This pattern enables Node.js to handle a high volume of concurrent operations, despite its single-threaded nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What is a non-blocking I/O architecture and how do non-blocking threads work?\n",
    "- Non-blocking I/O architecture is a design where input/output operations do not block the execution of other operations.\n",
    "- In such an architecture, I/O requests are handled asynchronously, allowing a program to continue executing while the I/O operation is being processed in the background.\n",
    "- In the context of Node.js, this is achieved using an event loop and callbacks.\n",
    "- When an I/O request is made, it is sent to the system kernel, and the application continues to execute subsequent code.\n",
    "- Once the I/O operation is complete, the callback function associated with that I/O request is pushed to the event loop to be executed.\n",
    "- This model enables Node.js to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently, making it ideal for I/O-heavy applications like web servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the code example showing the non-blocking threads work w.r.t I/O architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const fs = require('fs');\n",
    "\n",
    "fs.readFile('example.txt', (err, data) => {\n",
    "    if (err) throw err;\n",
    "    console.log(data.toString());\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log('Reading file asynchronously');\n",
    "// The program doesn't wait for readFile to complete and moves on to log 'Reading file asynchronously'.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. What is libuv?\n",
    "- libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. It provides the core functionalities of Node.js, including the event loop, and is responsible for handling I/O operations.\n",
    "#### Less briefly:\n",
    "- *Description*:\n",
    "    - libuv is a vital component of Node.js, providing a cross-platform support library focused on asynchronous I/O. It allows Node.js to handle many types of non-blocking I/O operations, including TCP and UDP sockets, file system operations, and DNS queries.\n",
    "    - *Functionality*: libuv implements the event loop and all of Node.js's asynchronous behaviors. It's designed around the reactor pattern, which enables efficient handling of I/O operations.\n",
    "    - *Thread Pool*: libuv also includes a thread pool to handle operations that are either CPU-intensive or cannot be performed non-blockingly on all supported OSes (like file system operations).\n",
    "    - *Cross-Platform*: It abstracts the underlying differences in various OSes, providing a consistent API for Node.js regardless of the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Name all stages of event loop.\n",
    "- The stages of the Node.js event loop are: timers, pending callbacks, idle/prepare, poll, check, and close callbacks.\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "    - Timers Phase: Executes callbacks scheduled by setTimeout() and setInterval().\n",
    "    - Pending Callbacks Phase: Handles I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop iteration.\n",
    "    - Idle, Prepare Phase: Used internally by Node.js, primarily for preparing upcoming I/O operations.\n",
    "    - Poll Phase: Retrieves new I/O events; Node.js will execute I/O-related callbacks (almost all with the exception of close callbacks, those scheduled by timers, and setImmediate()).\n",
    "    - Check Phase: setImmediate() callbacks are invoked here.\n",
    "    - Close Callbacks Phase: Executes callbacks for some close events, e.g., socket.on('close', ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Is Node.js single-threaded or multi-threaded?\n",
    "- Node.js is single-threaded for event handling but uses multiple threads in the background (via libuv) for tasks like file and network operations.\n",
    "- *Event Handling*: Node.js, in its core, operates on a single-threaded event loop for handling non-blocking I/O operations, making it lightweight and efficient for certain types of applications.\n",
    "- *Background Processing*: Despite its single-threaded nature, Node.js uses multiple threads in the background, facilitated by libuv's thread pool. This is where operations like file I/O, network operations, or any blocking system calls are executed.\n",
    "- *Worker Threads*: In recent versions, Node.js introduced Worker Threads to enable the execution of JavaScript on multiple threads, providing a way to perform CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the event loop.\n",
    "- *Hybrid Nature*: Therefore, Node.js is essentially a hybrid, using both single-threaded and multi-threaded techniques to optimize performance and resource management.\n"

    "**var**: Function-scoped, can be redeclared and updated (mainly used in the previous standard of ES).\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "var x = 5;\n",
    "var x = 10; // No error\n",
    "```\n",
    "let: Block-scoped, can be updated but not redeclared within the same scope.\n",

    "let b = { age: 20 }; // Object\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 9. What’s the difference between strict and non-strict (or loose) comparison?\n",
    "**Strict**: Checks equality without type conversion (===).\n",
    "**Non-Strict**: Converts types then checks equality (==).\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "console.log('5' === 5); // false\n",
    "console.log('5' == 5);  // true\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 10. What’s the difference between explicit and implicit type conversion?\n",
